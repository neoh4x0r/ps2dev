&nbsp;  
This is the main PS2 Repo for building the whole `PS2 Development` environment in your local machine.  
&nbsp;  
This program will automatically build and install the whole compiler and other tools used in the creation of homebrew software for the Sony PlayStationÂ® 2 videogame system.  

&nbsp;  
**Note:** previously bash scripts were used to clone and build the toolchain and associated libraries; however, the repository is now using `git submodules` and makefiles to make building and developing easier.

## Requirements

1.  Install gcc/clang, make, cmake, patch, git, texinfo, flex, bison, gettext, wget, gsl, gmp, zlib, mpfr and mpc if you don't have those packages.  
&nbsp;
1.  _Optional._ If you are upgrading from the previous version of the PS2DEV environment, it is highly recommended to remove the content of the PS2DEV folder before upgrade. This is a necessary step after the major toolchain upgrade.
    ```bash
    rm -rf $PS2DEV
    
    # if installed to a system folder
    
    sudo rm -rf $PS2DEV
    ```
1.  **This only applies if you install to a system folder**  
&nbsp;  
It is recommended to install to your home folder.  
&nbsp;  
Ensure that you have enough permissions for managing PS2DEV location (which defaults to `/usr/local/ps2dev`, but you can use a different path). PS2DEV location MUST NOT have spaces or special characters in its path! PS2DEV should be an absolute path. On Unix systems, if the command `mkdir -p $PS2DEV` fails for you, you can set access for the current user by running commands:
    ```bash
    export PS2DEV=/usr/local/ps2dev
    sudo mkdir -p $PS2DEV
    sudo chown -R $USER: $PS2DEV
    ```
1.  Add this to your login script (example: `~/.bash_profile`)
    **Note:** Ensure that you have full access to the PS2DEV path. You can change the PS2DEV path with the following requirements: only use absolute paths, don't use spaces, only use Latin characters.  
    ```bash
    export PS2DEV=$HOME/ps2dev
    export PS2SDK=$PS2DEV/ps2sdk
    export GSKIT=$PS2DEV/gsKit
    export PATH=$PATH:$PS2DEV/bin:$PS2DEV/ee/bin:$PS2DEV/iop/bin:$PS2DEV/dvp/bin:$PS2SDK/bin
    ```  
    **Note:** if you want to make these changes globally (ie. not per-user) then you can change the **PS2DEV** path to a system folder (like /usr/local/ps2dev) and add the above varibables to /etc/bash.bashrc (instead of ~/.bash_profile, etc).  
    &nbsp;
    
1. Run make without an argument (to build everything) or supply a target to build.
    ```bash
    $ make
    $ make [targets]
    ```
    
**Available make targets**:
+ **ps2toolchain** (equiavelent to supplying these three targets)
    + **ps2toolchain-dvp**
    + **ps2toolchain-iop**
    + **ps2toolchain-ee**
+ **ps2sdk**
+ **ps2sdk-ports**
+ **ps2-packer**
+ **ps2client**

**Note:** the **INSTALL_PREFIX** varibable in **makefiles/user_paths.mk** can be altered to setup a custom installation path -- by default the prefix is $HOME (the user's home directory), but it could be changed to **/usr/local**, or etc; however, if it is to be installed to a system path it would require running make as root. Also be sure that these paths match what you setup in step 4.

## Docker generation

This repo also uses CI/CD to create a docker image called `ps2dev/ps2dev:latest` per change. This is useful if you're a developer that wants to create/port an application to the PS2. You can compile your project using this docker image.  
&nbsp;  
**Note:** The switch to submodules and makefiles has not been tested with the
dockerfile, so it may not work.

### macOS

If you download the pre-built macOS binaries and get a security error such as _`"ps2client" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.`_, you can remove the quarantine attribute by running:
```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine path/to/prebuilt/ps2toolchain
```
